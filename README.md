# AngularJS based single page application for issue tracking, working with REST services.

   The system holds projects, which have issues. Each project has a leader (the person responsible for the project) , name, description, a project key (which should be generated by the client), a set of priorities which the projectâ€™s issues can use and some labels.
Each Issue has a title, description, issue key (which is automatically generated by the system), an assignee (the person responsible to resolve the issue), a status which must follow a specific status transition (more on that below), a due date, a priority (which is some of the available priorities for the project), some labels and user-made comments.

A status transition scheme describes the workflow of an issue. See the image below for an example scheme:

### Issue Tracker REST Services

Services base URL (in the Windows Azure cloud): http://softuni-issue-tracker.azurewebsites.net

Services help page (online documentation): http://softuni-issue-tracker.azurewebsites.net/help 

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the Issue-Tracking-System repository. You can get git from [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/)..

It also used a number of node.js tools to initialize. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone Issue-Tracking-System

Clone the Issue-Tracking-System repository using [git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/DiyanTonchev/Issue-Tracking-System.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```
Behind the scenes this will also call bower install. You should find that you have two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the needed tools 
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

###Run the Application

The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000`.
