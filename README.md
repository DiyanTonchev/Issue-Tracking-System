# AngularJS based single page application for issue tracking, working with REST services.

   The system holds projects, which have issues. Each project has a leader (the person responsible for the project) , name, description, a project key (which should be generated by the client), a set of priorities which the projectâ€™s issues can use and some labels.
Each Issue has a title, description, issue key (which is automatically generated by the system), an assignee (the person responsible to resolve the issue), a status which must follow a specific status transition (more on that below), a due date, a priority (which is some of the available priorities for the project), some labels and user-made comments.
A status transition scheme describes the workflow of an issue. See the image below for an example scheme:
